Abstract:

This note summarizes the effort on understanding the kMax fits of the RMC spectra.
Mistakes and internal inconsistencies found in the published results make it difficult
to rely on those when predicting RMC background to the search of mu- -->e+ conversion
process.

The executive summary is that in order to reliably predict RMC background to mu- --> e+,
Mu2e needs to measure the endpoint of the RMC photon spectrum on Al.

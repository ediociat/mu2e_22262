* Abstract: <TAB> to expand 

  This note summarizes the effort on understanding the kMax fits of the RMC spectra.
  Mistakes and internal inconsistencies found in the published results make it difficult
  to rely on those when predicting RMC background to the search of mu- -->e+ conversion
  process.

  The executive summary is that in order to reliably predict RMC background to mu- --> e+,
  Mu2e needs to measure the endpoint of the RMC photon spectrum on Al.

* building Pasha's 'rmc_fit' package and running code from it: <TAB> to expand 

  1. clone rmc_fit to a release area which has STNTUPLE checked out:

     git clone https://github.com/pavel1murat/rmc_fit.git

  2. follow instructions in rmc_fit/AAA_README.org
